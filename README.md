# EE413-Group1
This Repository made to submit Group 1 project for course 413

Project Title:
Audio Signal Classification using DSP Techniques

Course:
EE 413 – Applied Digital Signal Processing
Spring 2025 (242), King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals

Instructor:
Dr. Abdullah F. Al-Battal

This project involves classifying spoken digits (0–9) from audio recordings using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and machine learning. Students will extract features from audio signals using time-domain, frequency-domain, and wavelet-based methods, and then train a classifier to recognize the spoken digits. The project helps apply DSP concepts in a real-world application and enhances skills in signal analysis, Python programming, and teamwork.
